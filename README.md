# Project Description

The Library Management System is a web application built to manage books, authors, publishers, and borrowers in a library. It features an Admin Portal for performing CRUD operations on books, authors, and publishers. The User Panel allows registered users to browse, search, and borrow books. Users can also search and filter books by title, author, publisher, and other criteria. To borrow books, users must be registered in the system. This project showcases a full-stack Laravel application with an emphasis on database relationships, user authentication, and responsive front-end design using Bootstrap.
